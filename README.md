## Overview

This is my first project using TypeScript, and Tailwind. I've had experience using HTML and CSS, and React before, but this is my first time working with these new technologies.

### Deploy

### The challenge

Here are some of the challenges I faced during the project:

### 1. Learning a new language
TypeScript was completely new to me, and it took some time to get used to the syntax and type annotations. I had to read the documentation and watch some tutorial videos to understand how to work with it.

### 2. Managing state
Working with React's state management system was a bit of a challenge for me. It took some time to get used to the concept of lifting state up and passing props down.

### 3. Learning a new framework
Tailwind is a new CSS framework for me. It was quite different from other CSS frameworks I've used before, and it took some time to understand how to use the utility classes effectively.

### 4. Debugging errors
As with any new technology, I encountered some errors while working on this project. Debugging these errors took some time and required me to read documentation and look for solutions online.

## My process

Despite the challenges, I'm happy to have completed my first project using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. I learned a lot during the process and look forward to using these technologies in future projects.
